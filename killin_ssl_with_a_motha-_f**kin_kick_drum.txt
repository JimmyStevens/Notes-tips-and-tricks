SSL is way over complicated. Here's what to do: 

1. Obtain a key and a CSR on your computer/server (There are easy google sites that show you how to do this based on
   your operating system)

2. Send your CSR to the CA (There are easy google sites on how to do this). 

3. Receive all the stupid files that come with your SSL certificate (certificate/intermediaries/roots/CA files).

Step three is where a bunch of dumb-ass tech gurus confuse anyone learning how to do this. There is NO consistency. 

4. Easy way to handle the junk from step 3. 
  a - find the file that is labeled <your.domain.crt> and open it in a text editor, or do the following from command line 
      if you want to stroke your ego (but figure the command line out on your own). 
  b - open all other received files THAT DO NOT have the label 'root' or 'certificate authority'. 
  c - one-by-one paste ALL the code from the opened files below the <your.domain.crt> code (DO NOT leave out all the weird
      hash marks at the beginning and end of the file). 
  d - open any files labled 'root' or 'certificate authority' and paste their code to the bottom of your 
      <newly edited.your.domain.crt> file (it does not matter if 'root' code is before or after 'certificate authority code'. 
  e - be a boyscout and label this newly edited file <your.domain.bundled.crt>
  
  
  5. Put your .key file and newly bundled .crt file in correct locations per nginx instructions found in any easy to read
     google search result. 
     
     
     * Note to f*%k with your mind sometimes you get a .pem file. This file has the .key and the bundled.crt all in one file
       and is used with your server application (nginx/apache/etc.)
       
       When your ego is better use this command, but only if you are awesome:
       
       (openssl x509 -noout -modulus -in _fideliscm_com.crt | openssl md5 ;\ openssl rsa -noout -modulus -in _fideliscm_comkey.txt | openssl md5) | uniq
