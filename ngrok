Moving files between Operating Systems

OSX to Windows

From the OS X system
* Install ngrok via brew
* cd into the desired directory and run the command `http-server`
* open a second terminal and run ngrok http 8080 (or any desired port)
* copy the http or https forwarding address

From the Windows system
- open a browser and paste the forwarding address to access the files as if they are on the internet
