#### Detailed Steps

1. (Optional) Create a folder for our server called `server`.

2. In the 'server' folder initialize a new node project by running `npm init` (choosing the default for all prompts by pressing enter until finished).

3. Install dependencies by running `npm install express cors morgan nodemon`.

-   `express` runs the server

-   `cors` allows us to permit cross origin resource sharing

-   `morgan` is for logging (optional but recommended)

-   `nodemon` is for live reloading the server in development (optional but recommended)

5. Create a file for the server called `index.js`

6. Write/copy the following into `index.js`:

```
const express = require("express");
const cors = require("cors");
const morgan = require("morgan");

const PORT = process.env.PORT || 9001;
const app = express();
app.use(cors());
app.use(morgan("dev"));

app.get("/test", (req, res) => {
  res.send("server up and running");
});

app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server listening at ${PORT}`);
});
```

-   This is boilerplate to set up the server. It sets up a server that will run on port 9001 that will respond with `server up and running` to GET requests to `/test` (e.g. `localhost:9001/test`). It will also log requests.

7. Add start script to the node project by adding `"start": "nodemon index.js"` to your `package.json` scripts.
