Command Line Interface (CLI) - Global

Background: 
CLI for the Windows = Command Line

CLI for OSX/LINUX = Terminal 

For these notes the term ‘terminal’ will be used to mean any operating 
system unless otherwise noted. 

The terminal allows users to access and modify directories and files 
without leaving the keyboard. As well, there are some applications for 
modifying API’s that can only be accessed through the command line. 


Using Mac Terminal Only 
Some of the commands below may work on the Windows command line but are 
not guaranteed. There will be/is a different section below for Windows 
command line.

Where to begin:
	To access the terminal open your launchpad (the rocket ship on your dock) 
  and double click the icon that looks like a small black screen with a >_ 
  in it. 
  * If this doesn’t work then use Google to find it on your computer
