General Oganization: Systems --> Services --> Processess

Systems: Windows/Unix/Linux/Mac (https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/31632/what-is-the-linux-kernel-and-what-does-it-do/)

Windows Systems: Services vs Process (Think serving items on demand vs processing things that are actively moving)

http://compinfopro.com/services-processes/
 - Windows systems run most services the remaining run through svchost.exe as DLLs
  - services start processes
  - services are user independent and run upon startup or are started upon demand
   - processes include every running application
   - processes are user dependent
   - processes sometimes start services
