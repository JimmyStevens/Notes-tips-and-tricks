Ubuntu Tricks

1. Status of all services: $ systemctl status

2. List of all enabled services: $ systemctl list-unit-files | grep enabled

3. List all active ports on an IP: $ nmap IP

4. Filter (pipe) status of services in a directory: $ systemctl status | grep /example directory

5. See all active ports on your server with IDs: $sudo netstat pln

6. Shutdown/kill services: $ sudo kill PID# (as seen in $sudo netstat pln)

7. Change Ownership, recursively, to users chartiq and www-data in directory srv: $ chown -R chartiq.www-data /srv

8. Change permission modes recursively for users, groups, and global in directory /srv: $ sudo chmod -R 770 /srv

    The fist digit (first 7) in 770 is the permission of users. 7 = the highest permissions. 
  
    The second digit (second 7) in 770 is the permission of groups. 7 = the highest permissions.
  
    The third digit (only 0) in 770 is the permission of global. 0 = the lowest permissions.

9. To generate a random 32 digit password run: openssl rand -base64 32. 

10. To obtain logs run: tail -n <# of last logs> <location/logfile> or quicker with 50 lines run: tail -f <logfile>
11. To change users run: sudo su -<username> or sudo su -<leave blank> and then you are the `root` user.
