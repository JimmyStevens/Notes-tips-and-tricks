Node Package Manager (NPM) is a tool required to successfully run many webpages and applications. It allows users to
share open source code to accomplish tasks that are similar across many applications. 

Node: One or several files of code where each bit of code is independant and does one specific job in an application.

Package: a file of folder containing a package.json file
  - the package.json file is at the root of the node application and provides the node with metadata necessary to run
    the application. This data includes 'name:foo', 'version:bar', and not required but typically 'dependencies:foo', 
    as well as many other fields.

Module: any file of folder that is loaded via 'require' in a Node.js application
  -  packages can be in modules, but a package is not necessarily a module.
