Ubuntu Tricks

Status of all services: $ systemctl status

List of all enabled services: $ systemctl list-unit-files | grep enabled

List all active ports on an IP: $ nmap IP

Filter (pipe) status of services in a directory: $ systemctl status | grep /example directory

See all active ports on your server with IDs: $sudo netstat pln

Shutdown/kill services: $ sudo kill PID# (as seen in $sudo netstat pln)

Change Ownership, recursively, to users chartiq and www-data in directory srv: $ chown -R chartiq.www-data /srv

Change permission modes recursively for users, groups, and global in directory /srv: $ sudo chmod -R 770 /srv

  The fist digit (first 7) in 770 is the permission of users. 7 = the highest permissions. 
  
  The second digit (second 7) in 770 is the permission of groups. 7 = the highest permissions.
  
  The third digit (only 0) in 770 is the permission of global. 0 = the lowest permissions.

To generate a random 32 digit password run: openssl rand -base64 32. 

To obtain logs run: tail -n <# of last logs> <location/logfile> or quicker with 50 lines run: tail -f <logfile>
